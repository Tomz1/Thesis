abstract = {Majority (80 to 85{\%}) of all recorded maritime accidents are generally attributed to human error or associated with human error. Contribution of human error to maritime accidents has increased over a ten-year period 1991 to 2001 (Baker and Seah, 2004). Most of the accidents are the result of senseless and avoidable human errors. The concern about human factors is growing as human error is significantly implicated in so many marine accidents. Pomeroy and Tomlinson (2000) stated that many of the failures are actually the result of errors (i.e. latent failures) that have been designed and constructed into highly complex systems especially system integration and interfacing. The scale of damage suffered, taken together with the implication of human error as a major cause for the accidents, has made human factors study an important area of concern globally. Many individuals and organisations are involved in marine navigation risk management framework. The main focus is to enhance safety of mariner's performance through motivation, education and training, system design, and procedures and rules. Figure 1 is a systematic risk management framework adapted from Rasmussen (1997, 2000). The behaviours associated with the navigation process are at the lowest level and the international organisations responsible for setting laws, at the highest level. The way in which decisions of top levels influence activities of lower levels, and the feedback from lower levels to top levels, will be very important determinants of safety in marine navigation. In addition, some external dynamic forces will put pressures on the system and change the structure of the system over time (Rasmussen, 1997, 2000).},

@article{Lei2016,
abstract = {Rapid growth in location data acquisition techniques has led to a proliferation of trajectory data related to moving objects. This large body of data has expanded the scope for trajectory research and made it applicable to a more diverse range of fields. However, data uncertainty, which is naturally inherent in the trajectory data, brings the challenge in trajectory data mining and affects the quality of the results. Specifically, unlike trajectory collected from vehicles moving along road networks, trajectory data generated by vessels moving free in maritime space have increased the difficulty of sea traffic analysis and anomalous behavior detection. Furthermore, due to the huge volume and complexity of maritime trajectory data, it is hard to define the abnormality of movement behavior and detect anomalies. Additionally, traditional analysis and evaluation by human intelligence is overloaded with the dramatic increasing in amount of maritime trajectory data and is an inefficient approach. Thus, an effective automated method for mining trajectory data and detecting anomalies would be a valuable contribution to maritime surveillance. This paper explores the maritime trajectory data for anomalous behavior detection. We propose a framework for maritime trajectory modeling and anomaly detection, called MT-MAD. Our model takes into account the fact that anomalous behavior manifests in unusual location points and sub-trajectories in the spatial domain as well as in the sequence and manner in which these locations and sub-trajectories occur. This study therefore began by identifying outlying features required for anomaly detection, including spatial, sequential, and behavioral features. We then explore the movement behavior from historical trajectories and build a maritime trajectory model for anomaly detection. The proposed model accurately describes movement behavior and captures outlying features in trajectory data. We then developed an anomaly detection algorithm based on this model in which an indicator is used to evaluate suspicious behavior and scores trajectory behavior according to the defined outlying features. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed MT-MAD framework is capable of effectively detecting anomalies in maritime trajectories.},

abstract = {In recent years, electronic vessel tracking has provided abundant data on vessel movements to surveillance authorities. Researchers have begun looking at the use of this data for anomaly detection using a wide variety of data mining techniques. Here we tackle anomaly detection with Bayesian Networks, training them with real world AIS data and producing models at two different time scales — both moment to moment and for the track as a whole. The networks also incorporate additional real world data, including weather, vessel details and details about vessel interactions. We find that the generated networks are quite easy to examine and verify despite incorporating a large number of variables; that combining models at the two different scales improves performance in a variety of cases; and, ultimately, that Bayesian Networks prove a promising approach to anomaly assessment and detection.},

abstract = {In this paper, unsupervised clustering of normal vessel traffic patterns is proposed and implemented, where patterns are represented as the momentary location, speed and course of tracked vessels. The learnt cluster models are used for anomaly detection in sea traffic. The Gaussian Mixture Model is used as cluster model and a greedy version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used as clustering algorithm. The models have been trained and evaluated using real recorded sea traffic. A qualitative analysis reveals that the most distinguishing anomalies found in the traffic are vessels crossing sea lanes and vessels traveling close to and in the opposite direction of sea lanes. In order to detect complex anomalies involving multiple vessels and/or behavior that develop over time, a more sophisticated pattern model should be developed. Yet, the generality of the proposed model is stressed, as it is potentially applicable to other domains involving surveillance of moving objects.},

Different from the classification task on feature vectors, sequences do not have explicit features. Even with sophisticated feature selection techniques, the dimensionality of potential features may still be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to capture. This makes sequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In this paper, we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. We summarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains. We also provide a review on several extensions of the sequence classification problem, such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.},

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Maritime domain awareness is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports, harbors, offshore structures like oil and gas rigs and other types of critical infrastructure against common threats and illegal activities. Typical examples range from smuggling of drugs and weapons, human trafficking and piracy all the way to terror attacks. Limited surveillance resources constrain maritime domain awareness and compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine surveillance operations. In this article, we propose a novel situation analysis approach to analyze marine traffic data and differentiate various scenarios of vessel engagement for the purpose of detecting anomalies of interest for marine vessels that operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We consider such scenarios as probabilistic processes and analyze complex vessel trajectories using machine learning to model common patterns. Specifically, we represent patterns as left-to-right Hidden Markov Models and classify them using Support Vector Machines. To differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we explore fusion of data and information, including kinematic features, geospatial features, contextual information and maritime domain knowledge. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach using comprehensive real-world vessel tracking data from coastal waters of North America.},

In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarse resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically.

Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over the existing methods.},

abstract = {Maritime security is one of the latest buzzwords of international relations. Major actors have started to include maritime security in their mandate or reframed their work in such terms. Maritime security is a term that draws attention to new challenges and rallies support for tackling these. Yet, no international consensus over the definition of maritime security has emerged. Buzzwords allow for the international coordination of actions, in the absence of consensus. These, however, also face the constant risk that disagreements and political conflict are camouflaged. Since there are little prospects of defining maritime security once and for all, frameworks by which one can identify commonalities and disagreements are needed. This article proposes three of such frameworks. Maritime security can first be understood in a matrix of its relation to other concepts, such as marine safety, seapower, blue economy and resilience. Second, the securitization framework allows to study how maritime threats are made and which divergent political claims these entail in order to uncover political interests and divergent ideologies. Third, security practice theory enables the study of what actors actually do when they claim to enhance maritime security. Together these frameworks allow for the mapping of maritime security.},

abstract = {— Outlier detection has been a popular data mining task. However, there is a lack of serious study on outlier detection for trajectory data. Even worse, an existing trajectory outlier detection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub-trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, detects outlying line segments for trajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a tra-jectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second phase, we present a hybrid of the distance-based and density-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAOD correctly detects outlying sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.},

abstract = {Ships involved in commercial activities tend to follow set patterns of behaviour depending on the business in which they are engaged. If a ship exhibits anomalous behaviour, this could indicate it is being used for illicit activities. With the wide availability of automatic identification system (AIS) data it is now possible to detect some of these patterns of behaviour. Monitoring the possible threat posed by the worldwide movement of ships, however, requires efficient and robust automatic data processing to create a priority list for further investigation. This paper outlines five anomalous ship behaviours: deviation from standard routes, unexpected AIS activity, unexpected port arrival, close approach, and zone entry. For each behaviour, a process is described for determining the probability that it is anomalous. Individual probabilities are combined using a Bayesian network to calculate the overall probability that a specific threat is present. Examples of how the algorithms work are given using simulated and real data.},

abstract = {Understanding maritime traffic patterns is key to Maritime Situational Awareness applications, in particular, to classify and predict activities. Facilitated by the recent build-up of terrestrial networks and satellite constellations of Automatic Identification System (AIS) receivers, ship movement information is becoming increasingly available, both in coastal areas and open waters. The resulting amount of information is increasingly overwhelming to human operators, requiring the aid of automatic processing to synthesize the behaviors of interest in a clear and effective way. Although AIS data are only legally required for larger vessels, their use is growing, and they can be effectively used to infer different levels of contextual information, from the characterization of ports and off-shore platforms to spatial and temporal distributions of routes. An unsupervised and incremental learning approach to the extraction of maritime movement patterns is presented here to convert from raw data to information supporting decisions. This is a basis for automatically detecting anomalies and projecting current trajectories and patterns into the future. The proposed methodology, called TREAD (Traffic Route Extraction and Anomaly Detection) was developed for different levels of intermittency (i.e., sensor coverage and performance), persistence (i.e., time lag between subsequent observations) and data sources (i.e., ground-based and space-based receivers).},
